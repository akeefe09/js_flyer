# js_flyer
An endless runner-style game. Users must try to guide a flying object through obstacles. The helicopter can be made to move up with any key.

The more obstacles you pass, the more your streak grows.

**Wireframes**
The game takes place in a canvas window.

**Technologies**
The game is implemented with JavaScript and Canvas.

**Timeline**
Day 1: try to relearn how Canvas works, figure out how to get the basic outline of the project setup.

Day 2: have something actually appear on the screen, work on getting images of the object and obstacles working.

Day 3: focus on making the game playable.
