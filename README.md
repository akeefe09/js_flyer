# js_flyer
This will be a runner-style game, similar to Flappy Bird. Users will need to guide a flying object through obstacles.

**Functionality & MVP**
users should be able to
- control the flight of the object
- gain points the farther they get

**Wireframes**
The game will take place in a canvas window, with a title and links to my personal information/github above.

**Technologies**
The game will be implemented with JavaScript and Canvas.

There will likely need to be separate files for the game logic, the flying object, and the obstacles.

**Timeline**
Day 1: try to relearn how Canvas works, figure out how to get the basic outline of the project setup.

Day 2: have something actually appear on the screen, work on getting images of the object and obstacles working.

Day 3: focus on making the game playable.
